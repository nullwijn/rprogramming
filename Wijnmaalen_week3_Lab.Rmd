# Instructions

In Chapter 12, we explored many different ways to “look at” the numbers. 
For this lab, let’s explore the `mtcars` dataset that is included within R.

This activity description does not provide the same level of code prompts as 
previous labs – it is assumed that you remember or can look up the necessary code. 
The overall goal of this activity is to use `ggplot2` to show different attributes 
of the `mtcars` dataset. Please be sure to include both the code and the images 
that were generated with your assignment.

Add all of your libraries that you use for this assignment here.
```{r setup}
# Add your library below.

library(ggplot2)

```
# Generate the following visualizations:

## Step 1 - Histogram

Histogram of `mpg`

```{r, "Step 1"}
# Write your code below.

hist(mtcars$mpg)

```

---

## Step 2 - Boxplots

Boxplots of `mpg` by `cyl` (i.e. 3 box plots: one for all cars with 4 cylinders, 
one for all cars with 6 cylinders, and one with all the cars with 8 cylinders).

```{r, "Step 2"}
# Write your code below.

boxplot(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$cyl)

```

---

## Step 3 - MultiLine chart 

MultiLine chart of `wt` on the x-axis, `mpg` for the y-axis. 
With a line for each `am` (i.e. two lines). Also be sure to show each point on the chart.

```{r, "Step 3"}
# Write your code below.

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x=wt,y=mpg,group=am)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=am)) +
  geom_point(aes(color=am))

```

---

## Step 4 - Barchart

Barchart with the x-axis being the name of each car, and the height being `wt`.
Make sure to rotate the x-axis labels, so we can actually read the car name.

```{r, "Step 4"}
# Write your code below.

barplot(mtcars$wt,ylab="Weight",names.arg=row.names(mtcars),las=2)

```

---

## Step 5 - Scatter chart
Scatter chart with the x-axis being the `mpg` and the y-axis being the `wt` of the car. 
Have the color and the size of each “symbol” (i.e., circle) represent how fast 
the car goes (based on the `qsec` attribute).

```{r, "Step 5"}
# Write your code below.

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = mpg, y = wt, color = qsec, size = qsec)) +
  geom_point()
#I should've used ggplot on the homework as well. This looks way better haha
```
